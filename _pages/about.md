**Welcome!**

**Hello, 你好!**

I am a junior majoring in Economics, Mathematics, and Data Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I transferred from HKUST in 2023 (I am proud of having two years of study there!).

Since February 2025, I have had the honor of working as a Research Assistant for Professor Lydia Cox, an experience that has deepened my passion and research skills.

My academic interests include macroeconomics, growth, and international macro & trade. I am currently preparing my application for Economics PhD programs for Fall 2026 matriculation.

Feel free to contact me via email: [yyang773@wisc.edu](mailto:yyang773@wisc.edu) :)
