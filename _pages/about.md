I am a junior majoring in Economics, Mathematics, and Data Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I transferred from HKUST in 2023 (I am proud to have two years of study there!).

Since February 2025, I have had the honor of working as a Research Assistant for Professor Lydia Cox. This opportunity has not only enriched my research experience but also deepened my passion for economics.

Currently, I am preparing my application to Economics PhD programs for Fall 2026 matriculation.

Feel free to contact me via email at yyang773@wisc.edu :)
