**Welcome!**

**Hello, 你好!**

I am a junior majoring in Honor Mathematics, Economics, and Data Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I transferred from HKUST in 2023 (I am proud of having two years of study there!).

Currently, I am under the MXM Lab focusing on _Neural Network Parameterization for PDE-Constrained Optimization_.

I'm interesting in many fields across mathematics and economcis, including PDE, Analysis, Macroeconomics, Growth, International Macro & Trade, and stuffs about ML & RL. 

Feel free to contact me via email: [yyang773@wisc.edu](mailto:yyang773@wisc.edu) :)
