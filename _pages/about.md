I am a junior majoring Economics, Mathematics, and Data Science at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I transferred from HKUST since 2023 and I am proud to have two years of study at HKUST with Mathematics and Economics major. 

Currently, I am preparing for the application to Economics PhD programs for Fall 2026 matriculation.
