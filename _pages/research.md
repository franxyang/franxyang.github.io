## Research Experiences


### Neural Network Parameterization for PDE-Constrained Optimization
**Duration:** *Sep 2025 – Present*  
**Role:** Undergraduate Researcher (supervised by [Prof. Yukun Yue](https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/yukunyue/home))  
**Affiliation:** Madison Experimental Mathematics(MXM) Lab | Department of Mathematics, UW-Madison
**Resources:** [Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bo-Gexe0T9FAVcVra177hl-Ag7V_x3xR/view?usp=sharing)

- Developed a Deep Learning framework (JAX) to solve inverse problems for the Heat Equation, utilizing neural networks to parameterize unknown source terms and regularize the optimization landscape.
- Engineered an automatic differentiation pipeline combined with the Adjoint Method to compute gradients, achieving a relative $L_2$ error of <1.00% in recovering the true force function after 3000 epochs.
- Conducted comparative analysis between Vanilla MLPs and Chebyshev-basis networks, optimizing convergence speed and solution accuracy for complex spatiotemporal dynamics.

### The Effect of the Hong Kong Political Change during 2019 on Trade  
**Duration:** *Sep 2024 – Dec 2024*  
**Project Type:** Junior Thesis  
**Advisor:** [Prof. Lydia Cox](https://coxlydia.com/)  
**Resources:** [Intro Slides](https://uwmadison.box.com/s/q2714o38genhm73xe4xw7wobsq5hcwa9) | [View Here](https://uwmadison.box.com/s/3gkq1n4gnzggwauujf54592rzviexcqe)

- Quantified the impact of the 2019 political protests on Hong Kong’s trade performance relative to Singapore using a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach on bilateral trade flows (2005–2023).
- Constructed a comprehensive dataset by merging annual and monthly trade data, performing rigorous cleaning and robustness checks (placebo tests) to address potential multicollinearity.
- Identified a counter-intuitive positive differential effect post-2019 and performed heterogeneity analysis to attribute this anomaly to increased import substitution from Mainland China.

### Impact of Municipal Bond on Local Economic Growth  
**Duration:** *Jan 2024 – May 2024*  
**Project Type:** Sophomore Honor Thesis  
**Advisor:** [Prof. Simeon Alder](https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~sdalder/)  
**Resources:** [View Here](https://uwmadison.box.com/s/e8fkcc4fx6xhqz3qm0lfuhxjmtm56crn)

- Analyzed the fiscal multiplier effect of bond issuance by compiling a longitudinal panel dataset covering 298 Chinese cities over an 18-year period (2005–2022).
- Formulated Fixed-Effects regression models to control for unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity and regional disparities between coastal and inland provinces.
- Uncovered significant diminishing marginal returns of bond issuance on local GDP, providing empirical evidence for the necessity of debt-structure optimization in local government financing.

### U.S. Tariff History Project  
**Duration:** *Feb 2024 – Present*  
**Role:** Research Assistant (supervised by [Prof. Lydia Cox](https://coxlydia.com/))  
**Affiliation:** Department of Economics, UW-Madison

- Digitized and analyzed archival trade records to extract insights on agricultural trade patterns.
- Refined Python scripts to clean and validate the USIMC dataset obtained via AWS Textract.

### Measure Theory – Directed Reading Program  
**Duration:** *Sep 2023 – Dec 2024*  
**Role:** Participant  
**Affiliation:** Department of Mathematics, UW-Madison

- Engaged in a rigorous proof-based study of Real Analysis, mastering concepts beyond the standard curriculum including Lebesgue integration, $\sigma$-algebras, and properties of $L^p$ spaces.
- Analyzed critical convergence results (Monotone and Dominated Convergence Theorems) to rigorously distinguish the theoretical advantages of Lebesgue measure over Riemann integration in limit processes.
- Synthesized complex theoretical proofs into a final expository presentation, demonstrating the ability to deconstruct and communicate abstract mathematical concepts to professional audiences.
